            <p>Taruwara means “the best tree” in Sanskrit. Hence the tree logo in our building. We are a sustainable school and we encourage our children to engage the environment by allowing them to actively protect it. It starts in the classroom and through these small actions, the students will experience a sense of responsibility for the future generations.</p>
